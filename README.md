This project may not work with the latest Bukkit version (or at all) and may not receive any further updates by myself however, feel free to fork this and make improvements. I'll certainly consider any pull requests made and will try to assist with any issues.

#MBToggle

What it does:
- Allows a player to "toggle" the /mb (mod chat command) command. More specifically, anything said by the player will have /mb inserted in front of their text and thus would use that command instead of regular chat
- Could easily be modified to toggle a different command for any plugin on the server
